# python-scripts
Various automation scripts in Python. I use these for day to day sysadmin functions for managing Macs and iPads with Jamf Pro, though they aren't necessarily limited to those platforms. Some of these are borrowed either directly or in part from others.


### Scripts ###
**rename-pics.py** is a script to rename photos based on two columns in a .csv
